## Fizz Buzz

### Goal

For this project we would like you to design a program to recreate the FizzBuzz numbers game.

#### Rules

For the integers 1 through 100 inclusive program should:

- return Fizz for any multiple of 3
- return Buzz for any multiple of 5
- return FizzBuzz for any multiple of 3 & 5
- return the integer that was input if none of the above are true
